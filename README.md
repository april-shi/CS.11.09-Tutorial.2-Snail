If the above 2D was passed to this method, then an array resembling [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5] should be returned.

**TODO 6**

Takes a 1D array and returns a 2D array. The contents of the 2D array should be in a snail order traversal. Effectively, you are packing the 1D array into a snail formation.

If an array resembling [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] was passed to this method, then a 2D array resembling

{ 

  {1,2,3},
  
  {8,9,4},
  
  {7,6,5}
  
}

should be returned.
